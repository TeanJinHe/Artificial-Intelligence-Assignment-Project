    "Syntactic analysis deals with the structure and arrangement of words or phrases in a sentence. It primarily focuses on the grammatical rules and relationships between words to determine the syntactic structure of a sentence. This analysis involves tasks such as part-of-speech (POS) tagging, parsing, and dependency parsing. The goal is to understand the grammatical structure of a sentence without considering the precise meaning of the words. Syntactic analysis helps in identifying the roles of words in a sentence, such as subject, object, verb and others.\n",

    "Semantic analysis focuses on understanding the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences. It aims to capture the deeper meaning and interpretation of the text. This analysis involves tasks such as word sense disambiguation, named entity recognition, semantic role labeling, sentiment analysis, and question answering. Semantic analysis takes into account the context, domain knowledge, and world knowledge to derive the intended meaning of a sentence.\n",
